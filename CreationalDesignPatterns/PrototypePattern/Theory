When we need to copy the methods or fields from one object to another we need prototype pattern.
Because the fields can be private and object creation can be with the help of interface.
Animal dog = new Dog();
like in this we cannot access the methods of animal class but not the dog.
So we have to delegate the object creation process to the object itself.
that means we use cloneable interface to get the copy of the object from the object itself.
