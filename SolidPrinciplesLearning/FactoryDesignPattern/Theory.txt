Factory Pattern helps to create loosely coupled OOP design.
Whenever we use the new keyword we violate the principle.

If we program to an interface, the code will work fine with any other
classes implementing that interface.

Abstract Factory Pattern factories that creates other factories.

It is an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related
objects without explicitly specifying their classes.
