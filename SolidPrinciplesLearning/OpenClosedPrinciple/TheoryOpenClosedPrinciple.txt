In Software development, when ever there is requirement change, then change is needed in the code.
So design pattern of the application should take care of the frequent changes.

We make sure that the changes in the existing code should be minimum.
As the existing code has already been unit tested.

#Software Entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.
Closely related to single responsibility principle.

#Coding Logic
A class should not extend other class explicitly we should define common interface instead.
We can change the classes at run time due to common interface.
