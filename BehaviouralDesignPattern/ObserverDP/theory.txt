This is used one object has many dependencies with other objects,
to avoid tight coupling we use this DP.
In this there is one subject which is the main object and other as observers,
which are dependent on this subject and these subscribe to this subject,
and update themselves when ever there is any state change in subject.
This Design pattern has main objectives as follows:
1) We can add new observers without much modification
2) There is clear abstraction between observers and subject.
