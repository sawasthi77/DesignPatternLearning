Advantages of using solid principles:
1) Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
2) We can use the if-else statements and they are going to work fine but they are difficult to test.
3) So using the strategy pattern reduces the cyclomatic complexity of the application by reducing the number
of branches of application

what we have achieved by this:
1) Not violated open closed principle
we have used abstraction so that we can extend the functionality of the application.
2) Used dependency injection
we have used composition not inheritance so that for performing any run time operation we don't need to
change the entire code.
